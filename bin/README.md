# Bin Folder

This folder contains executable scripts for managing surveys and running scripts.

## Files:

1. `runner.js`: This script is responsible for executing various tasks related to survey management and data processing.

2. `show_survey.js`: This script allows users to view survey data and insights in a user-friendly format.

3. `.gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It helps to keep the repository clean by excluding files like temporary files or build artifacts from version control.

Feel free to explore and utilize these scripts to facilitate survey management and analysis efficiently. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out or contribute to the project. Happy surveying! ðŸ“Š
